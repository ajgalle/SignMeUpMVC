This a Overtime Sign Up system created using MVC (model-view-controller). I removed log-in restrictions so you can see it both
as an employee and as a manager without the tedium of various usernames and registration. 

Specifically, this system was built with C# in MS Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition and MS Server Management Studio. 

It draws its data from a MS Server utalizing Entity Framework.

It also incorporates jQuery, bootstrap, CSS3, HTML5, and more!

If you're interested: 
  1) A manager may create new overtime events, which are validated before they are put into the database. 
  2) The list of overtime events can be immediately viewed by any logged in employee, who may indicate their interest. 
  3) The Manager can Create, Update, Delete any overtime event. These changes are immediately visable to the user on their page. 
  4) To beautify the program, I make have use of bootstrap and CSS3.  There are modals, mobile responsive tables, animations, and more!
  5) The logic of the program is split into the model-view-control design pattern. 
  6) The communications between the MS Server are handled by both auto-generated and hand-coded Entity Framework objects.
  7) Please don't hesistate to contact me with any suggestions or comments. 

Thank you so much for checking it out!
